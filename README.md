As this is part of intelunnati training program we are submitting the project of problem statement - ROAD OBJECT DETECTION USING DEEP LEARNING -sub topic of pothole detection

 We gathered a dataset consisting of images and videos capturing road scenes with potholes. This dataset should be annotated with bounding boxes around the potholes.
Train the YOLOv4 object detection model using the annotated dataset. This involves feeding the images and videos into the model and adjusting the model's parameters to optimize pothole detection performance. we have dode this already using our dataset.
Detecting: Apply the trained YOLOv4 model to new images or videos containing road scenes to detect potholes. The model will analyse the input data and generate bounding boxes around the detected potholes.
The output of the project is the detection and localization of potholes in the input images or videos. This is represented by bounding boxes drawn around the detected potholes, indicating their position and size within the road scene.
